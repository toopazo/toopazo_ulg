The purpose of ulg_plot_mixer.py is to run a linear fit based on 
least square error for
    input = xvect = actuator_outputs
    output = yvect = actuator_controls
    
The important function is 
    [lsq_matrix, lsq_bias, lsq_error] = UlgPlotMixer.least_square_fit(xvect, yvect)
    
And the prediction is output = lsq_matrix*input + lsq_bias

The topic toopazo_ctrlalloc contains both the input and output and is used in 
the calculations
